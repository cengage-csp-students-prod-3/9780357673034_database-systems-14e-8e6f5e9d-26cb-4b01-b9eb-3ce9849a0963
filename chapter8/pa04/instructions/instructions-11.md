## Task 6:

The Marketing team of InstantStay wants to create mailing lists for the users. However, they need a single string which consists of all emails of the users combined (delimited) with a “;”. You need to create a procedure called **EmailList** which uses a `CURSOR` that iteratively collects the email addresses in the `USERS` table and appends them to the string value. In addition, run the procedure and return back them the email list.
