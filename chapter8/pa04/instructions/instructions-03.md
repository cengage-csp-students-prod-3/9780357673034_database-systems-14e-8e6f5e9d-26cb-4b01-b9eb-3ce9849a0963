## Task 2:

The Driver Relationship team wants to arrange workshops and education materials to the drivers. However, the team wants to create clusters of the drivers based on their experience in InstantStay. To collect these detail, you will need to create a SQL function called **DRIVER_STATUS** to determine the level of the driver as follows:

- **MASTER** more than 4 travels
- **PRO** more than 2 travels
- **ROOKIE** 2 or less travels

In addition, run the function to verify it works as expected and send them back the driver levels.
