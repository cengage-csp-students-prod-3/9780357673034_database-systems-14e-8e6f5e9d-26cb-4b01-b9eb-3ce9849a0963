The Driver Relationship team realized that maintaining driver IDs is difficult and requested an automatic way of incrementing the value when a new driver is added. You need to make the changes on the table to automatically increment the `DRIVER_ID`. After the change, you need to insert the following driver:

* First Name: Nursin
* Last Name: Yilmaz
* Driving License ID: 4141447 
* Start Date: 2021-12-28
* Driving License Checked: True
* Rating: 4.0
