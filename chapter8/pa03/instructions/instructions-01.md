## Task 1:

The Car Maintenance team wants to add new maintenance tasks to the `MAINTENANCES` table which was created in _Chapter 8, Activity 1_. However, the team also wants to insert the tasks in a batch into the database. In other words, they want to insert the rows all together without inserting one-by-one. Therefore, you will need to create a script to add the following tasks and ensure that they are added together:

- Car ID: 1001, Maintenance Type: 2, Due: 2022-06-01
- Car ID: 1003, Maintenance Type: 2, Due: 2022-06-01
