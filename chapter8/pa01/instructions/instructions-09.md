## Task 5:

The Driver Relationship team requested to ensure that there will be no duplicates in the active drivers tables in terms of first name, last name and driving license ID. You need to create a constraint in the `ACTIVE_DRIVERS` table, called **DuplicateCheck** to ensure the first name, last name, and the driving license ID are unique.
