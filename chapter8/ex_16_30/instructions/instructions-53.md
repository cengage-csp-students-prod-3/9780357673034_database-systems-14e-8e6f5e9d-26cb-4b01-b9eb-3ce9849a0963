## Problem 27
Write a procedure named `prc_cust_add` to add a new customer to the `CUSTOMER` table. Use the following values in the new record:

| CUIST_NUM | CUST_LNAME | CUST_FNAME | CUST_BALANCE |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1002     | Rauthor     | Peter     | 0.00 |

(You should execute the procedure and verify that the new customer was added to ensure your code is correct.)
