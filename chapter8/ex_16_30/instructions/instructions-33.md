## Problem 17
Create the `INVOICE` table structure illustrated in *Figure P8.16*. `INV_NUM` should store integer values. `INV_DATE` should store date values. `INV_AMOUNT` should support up to eight digits to the left of the decimal place and two digits to the right of the decimal place. Use `INV_NUM` as the primary key.  Note that the `CUST_NUM` is the foreign key to `CUSTOMER`, so be certain to enforce referential integrity.
