## Problem 16

Create the `CUSTOMER` table structure illustrated in *Figure P8.16*. The customer number should store integer values. The `CUST_FNAME` and `CUST_LNAME` attributes should support variable length character data up to 30 characters each. `CUST_BALANCE` should support up to eight digits on the left of the decimal place and two digits to the right of the decimal place. Use `CUST_NUM` as the primary key.
