Write a procedure named `prc_invoice_add` then call it to add a new invoice record to the `INVOICE` table. Use the following values for the new record:

| INV_NUM | CUST_NUM | INV_DATE | INV_AMOUNT |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
| 8006     | 1000     | 2022-04-30   | 301.72 |

(You should execute the procedure and verify that the new invoice was added to ensure your code is correct.)
