## Task 1:

The Car Maintenance team wants to pre-order some replacement parts for the cars registered in the InstantRide system. The team wants three sets of data:

- Number of cars with their build years as `CAR_YEAR` and `COUNT` columns
- Number of cars with the model number/details as `CAR_MODEL` and `COUNT` columns
- A summary of total cars with their model and build year together with `CAR_MODEL`, `CAR_YEAR` and `COUNT` columns with `ROLLUP` grouping

You need to send the requested data in three tables to the Car Maintenance team.
