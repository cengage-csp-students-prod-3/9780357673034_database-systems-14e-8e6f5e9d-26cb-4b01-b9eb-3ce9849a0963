## Task 4:

The InstantRide User Satisfaction team requires the average and maximum number of rides users have taken so far with InstantRide. In addition, they would like to know the total number of travels. However, they need these details with the corresponding column names **Average**, **Maximum** and **Total** by using the `AVG`, `MAX` and `SUM` functions. In order to accomplish this, you will first need to create a derived table from the `TRAVELS` table to pass the `TRAVEL_ID` count to the three mathematical functions.
