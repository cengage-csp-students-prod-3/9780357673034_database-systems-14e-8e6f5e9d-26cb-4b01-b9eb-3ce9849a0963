## Task 5:

The InstantRide Driver Relationship team wants to learn how many travels each driver has done in the month of October. You need to send them the **DRIVER_ID** and two calculated columns: **DAY** and **RIDES**.The `DAY` column is calculated using the `DAY()` function with the `TRAVEL_START_TIME` as the argument. The `RIDES` column is calculated by using the `COUNT()` function to determine the number of rides given for each day. Filter the results with the `MONTH` function.
