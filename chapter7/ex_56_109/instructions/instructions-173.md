## Problem 87
Write a query to display the patron ID, book number, and days kept for each checkout. “Days Kept” is the difference from the date on which the book is returned to the date it was checked out. Sort the results by days kept in descending order, then by patron ID, and then by book number (*Figure P7.87*). (68 rows)
