## Problem 77
Write a query to display the author ID, first name, last name, and year of birth for all authors. Sort the results in descending order by year of birth, and then in ascending order by last name (Partial results are shown in *Figure P7.77*). 

> Note: Some DBMS sort `NULLs` as being large and some DBMS sort `NULLs` as being small.)
