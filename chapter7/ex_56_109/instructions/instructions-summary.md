The CIS Department at Tiny College maintains the Free Access to Current Technology (FACT) library of e-books. FACT is a collection of current technology e-books for use by faculty and students. Agreements with the publishers allow patrons to electronically check out a book, which gives them exclusive access to the book online through the FACT website, but only one patron at a time can have access to a book. A book must have at least one author but can have many. An author must have written at least one book to be included in the system but may have written many. A book may have never been checked out but can be checked out many times by the same patron or different patrons over time. Because all faculty and staff in the department are given accounts at the online library, a patron may have never checked out a book or they may have checked out many books over time. To simplify determining which patron currently has a given book checked out, a redundant relationship between `BOOK` and `PATRON` is maintained.

For *Problems 57â€“109*, a figure of the correct output is provided for each problem. If the output of the query is very large, only the first several rows of the output are shown.
