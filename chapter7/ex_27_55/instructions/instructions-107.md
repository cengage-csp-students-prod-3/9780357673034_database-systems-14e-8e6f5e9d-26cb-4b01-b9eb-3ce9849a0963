## Problem 54
One of the purchasing managers is interested in the impact of product prices on the sale of products of each brand. Write a query to display the brand name, brand type, average price of products of each brand, and total units sold of products of each brand. Even if a product has been sold more than once, its price should only be included once in the calculation of the average price. However, you must be careful because multiple products of the same brand can have the same price, and each of those products must be included in the calculation of the brandâ€™s average price. Sort the result by brand name (*Figure P7.54*).
