## Task 2:

The InstantRide Management team considers setting up a Lost & Found inventory. In order to start the setup, the team requires the detail of users with their travel start and end times. The team wants to track potential list of users who may have forgotten their items on the cars. Therefore, you need to return **USER_FIRST_NAME**, **USER_LAST_NAME**, **TRAVEL_START_TIME**, **TRAVEL_END_TIME** information from the `USERS` and `TRAVELS` tables connected inside a `JOIN` statement by the `USING` function and `USER_ID` field.
