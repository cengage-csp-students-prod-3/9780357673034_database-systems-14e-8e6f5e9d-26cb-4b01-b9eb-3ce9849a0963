## Task 4:

The InstantRide Driver Relationship team wants to create groups for drivers according to their ratings such as 3+ or 4+. For instance, a driver with the rating _3.8_ will be _3+_; whereas a driver with the rating _4.2_ will be _4+_. You need to return a two column output with **DRIVER_ID** and **DRIVER_RATING** which has first `FLOOR` applied and then `CONCAT` with `+` sign for all drivers with a rating greater than **0**.
