## Task 5:

The InstantRide User Satisfaction team are looking forward to creating discounts for the users. However, the team suspects that there could be duplicate users in the system with different emails. Check for the users with their names and surnames for potential duplicates. Therefore, you need to `JOIN` the `USERS` table with `USERS` table and compare for equality of `USER_FIRST_NAME` and `USER_LAST_NAME` and inequality in `USER_ID` fields.
