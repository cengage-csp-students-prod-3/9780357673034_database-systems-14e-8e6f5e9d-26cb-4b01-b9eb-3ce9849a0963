## Task 1:

The InstantRide received some traffic violation tickets from the government. The Legal team of InstantRide requires the travel information of the respective drivers along with corresponding Driving License IDs to proceed further. In addition, the team wants to include the drivers without travel information in the system yet for the completion of driver list. Therefore, you need to return **DRIVER_FIRST_NAME**, **DRIVER_LAST_NAME**, **DRIVER_DRIVING_LICENSE_ID**, **TRAVEL_START_TIME**, **TRAVEL_END_TIME** information from the `DRIVERS` and `TRAVELS` data connected by `LEFT JOIN`.
