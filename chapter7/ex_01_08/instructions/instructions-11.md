## Problem 6
Using the data in the `ASSIGNMENT` table, write the SQL code that will yield the total number of hours worked for each employee and the total charges stemming from those hours worked, sorted by employee number. The results of running that query are shown in *Figure P7.6*.

<img src="../assets/Figure-P7.6.png" alt="Result for total hours and charges by employee is displayed in 4 columns, employee underscore number, employee underscore L name, sum of ASSIGN underscore hours and sum of ASSIGN underscore charge.
