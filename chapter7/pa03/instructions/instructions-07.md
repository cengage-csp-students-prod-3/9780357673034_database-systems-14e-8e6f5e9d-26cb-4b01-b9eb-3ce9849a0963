## Task 4:

The InstantRide Finance team also wants to analyze travels where more than the average discount rate is applied. They want to look for any correlation between higher discount amounts against other travel characteristics. You need to create a **SELECT** statement which is filtered with a subquery to calculate the **AVG** of the `TRAVEL_DISCOUNT` column.
